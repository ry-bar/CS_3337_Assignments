I have urgent information from the future for you. I've recently learned how dependable and reliable SMTP
protocol is. I have no doubt, unless for some strange reason this email is carelessly deleted immediately
upon receipt, that you will be able to act upon the information you are about to receive. In just a little
over one month toilet paper will become scarce and nearly unobtainable. Please, heed my warning and stock up
now, before it is too late. There is no point in both of us being caught off guard in these dark times.

With care,
You're friend from the future
